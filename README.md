# spect_scaled
Frequency-scaled power spectra for Pure data. Pure data version >= 0.45 is needed.

Real-valued STFT power spectra are frequency-scaled using triangular windows.
The frequency scale can be arbitrary - currently log and mel scales are implemented.

The main Pure data abstraction is spect_scaled.pd. 
The accompanying help file spect_scaled-help.pd provides an example.
